    <h2>Nurse Turned Web Developer</h2>
    <p>I have always loved the process of creating and designing which is why I left nursing for more creative pursuits. 
        In 2022, I dabbled in freelance digital marketing, social media management, and video and image-based content creation. 
        I began learning to build simple websites for my clients using a SaaS and that was when my interests turned to web development.</p>
    <p>As of mid 2023, I started learning web development full-time with hope of becoming an official web developer one day. Though it is quite difficult, I have enjoyed the journey very much!
        Let's connect and see how we can collaborate!</p>
